working with basic commands
mkdir l
rm -r l
touch a.txt creating a new file
cp a.txt b.txt copies all contents to B.TXT
mv a.txt b.txt (moves content of a into b and removes file a) 

git pull
git status                           checks status of local branch with origin branch
git add --all or git add <file name> obtained from status
git commit -m "add necessary commit message which appears against your file in GitHub or code repo"
git push --all 

git log
git reset --hard HEAD~1             (reverts back last commit removes last commit)
git reset --hard <specific commit id from git log>   (reverts back to particular commit)
  
git push origin <branch name> --force  (we need to force push from local branch that on your system to origin branch i.e exact branch in repo)
